# A very simple photo stream experiment

[tldr; running here](https://notmodified.github.io/photo-experiment/)

Uses some simple tools to pull a photo feed into the browser and display it.

After a `yarn` to fetch dependencies,

For local dev :
`yarn start` (npm probably works too)

For 'production' build :
`yarn build`
