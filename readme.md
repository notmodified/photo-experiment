# A very simple photo stream experiment

[tldr; running here](https://notmodified.github.io/photo-experiment/)

Uses some simple tools to pull a photo feed into the browser and display it.

For a far more ambitious photo stream related experiment [have a look over here](https://github.com/notmodified/mosaic-experiment)

After a `yarn` to fetch dependencies,

## For local dev :
`yarn start` (npm probably works too) this should leave something running at http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/index.html

## For 'production' build :
`yarn build` will leave everything in /dist
